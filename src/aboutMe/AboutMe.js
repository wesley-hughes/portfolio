<p>Hey there, I'm Wesley, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you. One of my favorite things to do is create. There's something so satisfying about building things with my own two hands. Currently, I'm working on a chicken run for my Aunt, and I'm having a blast doing it.</p>
<p>Growing up on a farm in West TN, self-sufficiency was just a way of life. We grew our own food and hunted for our meals, and it was a huge part of my upbringing. Even to this day, my dad still lives on the farm and continues to grow, hunt, and fish for much of his own food. It's a lifestyle that has instilled in me the values of resourcefulness and self-reliance.</p>
<p>When I'm not building things, I love being outdoors. One of my favorite activities is hiking with my dog Poppy and my partner Vision. We love exploring the mountains of Tennessee and finding hidden trails with stunning views. I'm also a big fan of biophilic design, which is all about bringing the outside world inside. I can spend hours searching for pictures of AI-generated biophilic homes, filled with plants and moss.</p>
<p>I'm an enneagram four and an INFP, which means I'm a natural people-pleaser who finds fulfillment in helping others. My dream is to travel to Asia and experience all the incredible views it has to offer, from tropical paradises to magical forests. I'm constantly dreaming of new adventures and experiences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my dream is to live in a house surrounded by trees and continue exploring the outdoors and creating with my hands. Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I can't wait to learn more about you too!</p>
